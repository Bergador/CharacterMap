# CharacterMap

WoW vanilla addon (1.12.1) that enables you to paste special characters such as Ä, ñ, ‰, ☻, ♥ (and many others) into the ingame chat box.

Use /cm show to show a menu of available characters. Hold the shift, control, and alt keys, or combinations of them, to cycle through all available characters.

This is a backport of the TBC addon by Mirrored @ Dragonmaw US with the same name.
